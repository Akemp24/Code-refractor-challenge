# Code Refractor Challenge

## Description

This project was created to get a better understanding of simple HTML and CSS properties. Reviewing this code helped me understand the logical flow of a HTML sheet and CSS stylesheet. It also helped me to understand how to add links inside a HTML sheet so that it takes you somewhere else in the webpage. It also helped me understand the different types of semantic HTML elements. I learned more of the git commands as well as deploying a website with git pages.
